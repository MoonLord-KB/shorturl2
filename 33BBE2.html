<title>Boy Meets World&amp;#39;s Danielle Fishel Shares TGIF Love For Jodie Sweetin And Andrea Barber&amp;#39;s New Full House Project!Danielle Fishel, known for her role in &amp;quot;Boy Meets World,&amp;quot; has shown her support for her former TGIF co-stars Jodie Sweetin and Andrea Barber as they launch their new podcast called &amp;quot;How Rude, Tanneritos!&amp;quot; The podcast focuses on a rewatch of the popular show &amp;quot;Full House.&amp;quot; Fishel, who currently co-hosts the &amp;quot;Pod Meets World&amp;quot; podcast with Rider Strong and Will Friedle, shared her excitement for Sweetin and Barber&amp;#39;s new venture on her Instagram stories.  Fishel and Sweetin have maintained a close friendship over the years, with Sweetin appearing as a guest on &amp;quot;Pod Meets World.&amp;quot; is expected that Fishel will also make an appearance on &amp;quot;How Rude, Tanneritos!&amp;quot; when they reach the episodes she appeared in during Season 6 of &amp;quot;Full House.&amp;quot;  Interestingly, just days before the launch of &amp;quot;How Rude, Tanneritos!,&amp;quot; another &amp;quot;Full House&amp;quot; co-star, Dave Coulier, launched his own rewatch podcast called &amp;quot;Full House Rew.&amp;quot; While it is unclear if these podcasts were planned separately or influenced by each other, fans can look forward to different perspectives from Joey (Coulier) and Stephanie and Kimmy (Sweetin and Barber) through their respective podcasts.  The first episode of &amp;quot; Rude, Tanneritos!&amp;quot; is now available on Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Fans can listen to Sweetin and Barber reminisce about their time on &amp;quot;Full House&amp;quot; as they prepare to rewatch the series from the beginning. Hopefully, Fishel will join them on an episode soon, bringing the TGIF family full circle.</title>
